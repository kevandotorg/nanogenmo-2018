# Out of Nowhere
My NaNoGenMo entry for 2018 is a 50,000-word stage play generated from late 19th and early 20th century European phrasebooks. Among a cast of seventeen, each character is assigned their own phrasebook and will only use verbatim sentences from it as their dialogue.

Dialogue is generated such that lines tend to be similar to or otherwise follow on from the previous one. Stage directions and scenery are created to match the generated dialogue of each scene.
